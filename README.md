### Hi there 👋

I'm starting my 3rd year as a B.Sc. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Ben-Gurion University.
My main interests are **VLSI Design & Verification**, processor architecture, and **Object-Oriented Programming**.

This GitHub is where I share academic and personal projects that reflect my progress in hardware and software development.
My work ranges from low-level **MSP430 Assembly** implementations to complex **Python OOP** simulations, demonstrating capabilities in both hardware control and software architecture.

* [**OOP-Battle-Simulation**](https://github.com/yonisartov/OOP-Battle-Simulation) – A Python-based object-oriented simulation engine demonstrating inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation principles.

* [**GPIO_interrupts**](https://github.com/yonisartov/GPIO_interrupts) – Finite State Machine triggered by button interrupts: binary counter, walking LED, square-wave generator.

* [**Timers**](https://github.com/yonisartov/Timers) – Timer_A in capture and countdown modes: LCD countdown timer and external frequency measurement.

* [**Analog_to_digital**](https://github.com/yonisartov/Analog_to_digital) – ADC10 sampling and classification of analog inputs (sine, triangle, PWM) with results displayed on LCD.

Always curious to learn new technologies in hardware and software, and to expand my practical experience.
