### Hi there 👋

I am currently in the middle of my 3rd year as a B.Sc. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Ben-Gurion University.
My passion lies at the intersection of **Hardware and Software** — specifically in **Chip Design**, **Embedded Systems**, and **Hardware-Software Integration**.

This GitHub is where I share academic and personal projects that demonstrate my technical versatility.
My work ranges from low-level **MSP430 Assembly** for direct hardware control to advanced **Python OOP** for simulations and automation scripting.

* [**OOP-Battle-Simulation**](https://github.com/yonisartov/OOP-Battle-Simulation) – A Python-based object-oriented simulation engine demonstrating inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation principles.

* [**GPIO_interrupts**](https://github.com/yonisartov/GPIO_interrupts) – Finite State Machine triggered by button interrupts: binary counter, walking LED, square-wave generator.

* [**Timers**](https://github.com/yonisartov/Timers) – Timer_A in capture and countdown modes: LCD countdown timer and external frequency measurement.

* [**Analog_to_digital**](https://github.com/yonisartov/Analog_to_digital) – ADC10 sampling and classification of analog inputs (sine, triangle, PWM) with results displayed on LCD.

Always curious to learn new technologies, tackle complex engineering challenges, and expand my practical experience.
