# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 2nd-year B.Sc. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Ben-Gurion University.  
My main interests are **chip design, processor architecture, and embedded systems**.  

This GitHub is where I share academic and personal projects that reflect my progress in hardware and software development.  
So far, Iâ€™ve worked mainly with **MSP430 microcontrollers in Assembly**, building small systems around **GPIO interrupts, timers, and ADC signal processing**.  

- **[GPIO_interrupts](https://github.com/yonisartov/GPIO_interrupts)** â€“ Finite State Machine triggered by button interrupts: binary counter, walking LED, square-wave generator.  
- **[Timers](https://github.com/yonisartov/Timers)** â€“ Timer_A in capture and countdown modes: LCD countdown timer and external frequency measurement.  
- **[Analog_to_digital](https://github.com/yonisartov/Analog_to_digital)** â€“ ADC10 sampling and classification of analog inputs (sine, triangle, PWM) with results displayed on LCD.
